# Contributing

Thanks for being willing to contribute!

## What to contribute

It is encouraged to create a Pull Request with a change directly without preliminary issue. As this is a documentation site, it will be always easier to **do a change** instead of suggesting **what to do**. Keep that in mind!

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_
series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][egghead]

## Project setup

For a simplest changes like typos feel free to use use [GitHub editing capabilities](https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository).

For a more extensive work it's recommended to run a project locally to see changes the same way they will look on the site.

1.  Fork and clone the repo
2.  Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
3.  Use `yarn start` to run development version of site
