# Side effects and observables

You might have been using [`React.useEffect`][useeffect] for several reasons, eg. setting `document.title` dynamically or for managing timers.

What if your side effect actually depends on observable value? Don't worry, MobX got you covered.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { autorun } from 'mobx'

function useDocumentTitle(store: TStore) {
  React.useEffect(
    () =>
      autorun(() => {
        document.title = `${store.title} - ${store.sectionName}`
      }),
    [], // note empty dependencies
  )
}
```

Important realization here is that you will **never** need to specify dependencies for `useEffect` because there are simply none. Or to be more precise it does depend on `store` variable, but that's the same case as for `React.useRef` which value you shouldn't specify in dependencies also.

> It surely is slightly verbose. We might eventually provide utility hooks like `useAutorun` or `useReaction`, but these are very easy to make on your own if you don't want to wait.

Since the `autorun` (and others from MobX family) returns a disposal function, it's ensured that `useEffect` will take care of disposal on unmount of the component.

## Non-observable dependencies

What if effect depends on value from eg. props? One way is to specify it in dependency array of `useEffect` as you have been taught. However that means a reaction would be recreated and that's not very effective. In fact it wouldn't even work because reaction is not executed immediatelly by default (see [`fireImmediatelly` option][reaction]).

Much better way is to `useAsObservableSource` ([learn more](/state-outsourcing)). Instead of constantly thinking what dependencies you should be providing, you simply use observables and let MobX figure out the rest. Isn't it great?

```ts
import React from 'react'
import { reaction } from 'mobx'
import { useAsObservableSource } from 'mobx-react' // 6.x

function useFetcher<T>(
  resource: string,
  baseUrl = process.env.BASE_URL,
): T | null {
  const store = useStore()
  const source = useAsObservableSource({ url: `${baseUrl}/${resource}` })
  const [result, setResult] = React.useState(null)

  const doFetch = (fetchUrl: string) => {
    store.setLoading(true)

    fetch(fetchUrl)
      .then(result => {
        setResult(result)
      })
      .catch(err => {
        store.setError(err)
      })
      .finally(() => {
        store.setLoading(false)
      })
  }

  React.useEffect(
    () => reaction(() => `${source.url}/${store.itemId}`, doFetch),
    [],
  )

  return result
}
```

### Non-reactive side effects

With the help of `useFetcher` hook we defined above we can showcase another approach for tackling side effects.

```tsx
const BookDetail = ({ bookId }) => {
  const store = useStore()
  const result = useFetcher<TBook>(`/books/${bookId}`)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `${result.title} - ${store.sectionName}`
  })

  return useObserver(() => {
    if (store.loading) {
      return <Loading />
    }
    if (store.error) {
      return <ErrorDisplay error={store.error} />
    }
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{result.title}</h1>
      </div>
    )
  })
}
```

There are no dependencies for `useEffect` meaning it will run on every render. It's definitely ok in this case because `useFetcher` is a major cause of re-rendering of the component.

However, if the `sectionName` would be changing on its own, the `autorun` would need to be used again to capture observable nature of it.

> Using `observer` HOC here would not solve anything because it cannot see inside the `useEffect` callback.
