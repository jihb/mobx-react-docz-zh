# Libraries

By the end of the year 2018 there was a unified way of using MobX in React world - library [mobx-react].

Then the [React Hooks] came to the light. The [mobx-react-lite] was made to support this brave new world. It was great for several enthusiasts, but newcomers did (and still do) suffer.

**Use [mobx-react-lite] for fresh new project on React Hooks. For any older project continue reading.**

> In not so distant future the `mobx-react-lite` might be deprecated and become a `mobx-react`.
>
> Don't worry, migration will be as easy as replacing one string for another.

## Cannot use React Hooks yet?

🤷‍♂️ _Your code has class components while Hooks (React 16.8+) are out of reach?_

👌 Just stay with `mobx-react@5`, no worries.

## Migrating to React Hooks?

🤷‍♂️ _Class components still do exists in your code, but you can (and want) to use Hooks as well?_

👌Use `mobx-react@6` which includes `mobx-react-lite` and uses it automatically for function components.

> The Provider/inject in `mobx-react@6` has been migrated to [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), however it might be removed in future versions completely. Consider [using Context](/recipes-context) directly.

## Fully embraced Hooks?

🤷‍♂️ _No class components in your code?_

👌 Use the `mobx-react-lite` directly as a smaller and faster variant.

> The library does not include way of propagating state (Provider, inject), see more about [accessing state](/state-how#accessing-a-state).

# What version of `mobx`?

There are currently two maintained versions of `mobx`, the V4 (LTS) and V5. You can use either of those with any library mentioned above. The major difference is if you need to support IE11 which lacks ES6 Proxy support (MobX V5 depends on them).
