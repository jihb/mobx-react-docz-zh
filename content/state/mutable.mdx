# Mutable state

Important aspect of MobX state is its mutability.

On the contrary of popular solutions like Redux or [useReducer] which works best with immutable data structures, the MobX is based on direct mutability to [notify any subscribers](/observe-why) about the change.

Since reference to MobX state object doesn't change over time, you can avoid checks that are needed with immutable state.

> It's very common pattern to see `shouldComponentUpdate` with a bulky checks to avoid unnecessary renders. This isn't needed with MobX at all.
